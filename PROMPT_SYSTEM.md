# üéØ Customizing Your AI Letter Writer's Voice

This guide explains how to configure the AI to write letters that reflect your personal political views, values, and communication style.

## üìã Overview

The AI Letter Writer uses a custom prompt file (`prompt.md`) to determine:
- Your political perspective and values
- Policy priorities and positions
- Communication tone and style
- How to frame arguments and appeals

Without a custom prompt, the system uses a neutral, professional tone suitable for any constituent.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Copy the example template:**
   ```bash
   cp prompt.md.example prompt.md
   ```

2. **Edit prompt.md with your information:**
   - Replace the example name and address with yours (or leave blank - it uses sender.json)
   - Add your political philosophy and values
   - Define your policy positions
   - Set your preferred tone and style

3. **Test the system:**
   ```bash
   python ai_writer.py
   ```

## üìù Prompt Structure

Your `prompt.md` file should include these sections:

### 1. Identity Statement
Define who you are as a constituent:
```markdown
You are **[Your Name]**, a constituent from **[Your City, State]**.
You write to elected officials with a **[describe your political perspective]** voice.
```

### 2. Core Values & Beliefs
List your fundamental political principles:
```markdown
## Core Identity & Beliefs

### Constitutional Values
[Your views on democracy, the Constitution, rule of law, etc.]

### Economic Philosophy

- **[Professional/Passionate/Direct/Diplomatic]**
- **[Fact-focused/Story-driven/Data-oriented]**

```

```

## üîß Advanced Customization

### Issue-Specific Framing
You can specify how to approach specific topics:

```markdown
### When writing about healthcare:

- Appeal to [compassion/efficiency/freedom/fairness]

### When writing about taxes:

- Use [class-based/economic/moral] arguments
```

### Audience-Specific Tone
Adjust tone based on the recipient:

```markdown
### For Republican officials:
- Emphasize [conservative values you share]
- Frame arguments in [their ideological terms]

### For Democratic officials:
- Emphasize [progressive values you share]
- Frame arguments in [their priorities]
```

### Regional/Local Context
Include local perspectives:

```markdown
### Oklahoma-specific context:

```

## üí° Tips for Effective Prompts

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Be specific about your values and positions
- ‚úÖ Include nuance where your views don't fit neat categories
- ‚úÖ Specify how to handle controversial topics
- ‚úÖ Define your red lines and non-negotiables
- ‚úÖ Include positive examples of policies you support

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Include personal attacks or inflammatory language
- ‚ùå Advocate for illegal activities
- ‚ùå Include hate speech or discrimination
- ‚ùå Make threats or ultimatums
- ‚ùå Include false or misleading information

## üîÑ Testing Your Prompt

After creating your prompt.md, test it:

1. **Generate a test letter:**
   ```bash
   python ai_writer.py
   ```

2. **Review the output for:**
   - Does it reflect your values?
   - Is the tone appropriate?
   - Are your policy positions clear?

3. **Refine as needed:**
   - Adjust sections that don't sound right
   - Add more specific guidance for issues you care about
   - Fine-tune the tone and style

## üìä Default Behavior

If you don't create a custom prompt.md, the system uses a neutral default that:
- Maintains professional, respectful tone
- Focuses on facts and evidence
- Avoids partisan language
- Makes clear, specific requests
- Works for any political perspective

This default is suitable for basic constituent communication but won't reflect your personal political views.

## üîí Privacy Note

Your `prompt.md` file is:
- **Ignored by git** (won't be committed to version control)
- **Local only** (never sent anywhere except to OpenAI for letter generation)
- **Personal** (reflects your individual views)
- **Replaceable** (can be updated or changed anytime)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Letters don't reflect my values
- Make your prompt.md more specific
- Include explicit policy positions
- Add more examples of desired framing

### Tone is too aggressive/passive
- Adjust the "Tone & Letter Style" section
- Add specific guidelines for disagreement
- Include examples of preferred language

### AI ignores my prompt
- Check that prompt.md exists in the correct location
- Ensure the file isn't empty
- Verify no syntax errors in markdown

### Want different styles for different issues
- Add issue-specific sections
- Include conditional guidance
- Specify different tones for different topics

## üìö Examples Library

For more prompt examples and templates, consider:
- Creating multiple prompt files (prompt-progressive.md, prompt-conservative.md)
- Switching between them by copying to prompt.md
- Building a library of issue-specific sections
- Sharing templates with like-minded users (outside the git repo)

## ü§ù Contributing

While your personal prompt.md is private, you can:
- Share prompt templates with others
- Contribute examples to documentation
- Suggest improvements to the prompt system
- Help others craft effective prompts

Remember: Your prompt.md is your political voice. Make it authentic to your beliefs and values.
